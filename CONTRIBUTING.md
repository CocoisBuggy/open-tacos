### Contributing Code
We use the standard GitHub pull-request workflow.  
We ask new contributors to first fork the repo and submit pull requests from your fork.  Frequent contributors are invited to join the core dev team which has Write access to this repo.  You can then push to the repo without having to maintain a fork.

1.  Look for issues with [`help wanted`](https://github.com/OpenBeta/open-tacos/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22help+wanted%22) or [`good first issue`](https://github.com/OpenBeta/open-tacos/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22) labels.
2.  To work on a trivial issue, simply assign the issue to yourself and start coding.
3.  To tackle a more comple issue or a new feature, we ask that you propose your changes or design before beginning the work. 
4.  As always, if you are blocked, ask for hep in the [Discord chat server](https://discord.gg/xcWha22BhT).
